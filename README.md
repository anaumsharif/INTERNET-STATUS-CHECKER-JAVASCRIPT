## INTERNET STATUS CHECKER - JavaScript

The **INTERNET STATUS CHECKER** project is a simple web application built using JavaScript that allows users to check the status of their internet connection. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and implementation details.
The INTERNET STATUS CHECKER project is a web-based application designed to quickly assess the status of an internet connection using JavaScript. This project provides a simple and effective way to inform users about their current internet connectivity status by attempting to fetch a resource from a specified URL and displaying real-time feedback.

### Project Overview

The **INTERNET STATUS CHECKER** project enables users to quickly determine whether they have an active internet connection by attempting to fetch a resource from a specified URL. This project is useful for verifying internet connectivity in web-based applications and alerting users if there is an issue with the connection.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Internet Connection Check**:
  - Attempts to fetch a resource (e.g., an image) from a specified URL to determine if the internet connection is active.
  
- **Real-time Status Display**:
  - Updates the status message dynamically to indicate whether the internet connection is available or not.
  
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handles network errors and displays appropriate messages to inform users about connection issues.

### Usage Instructions

To use the **INTERNET STATUS CHECKER** application:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/INTERNET-STATUS-CHECKER-JAVASCRIPT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd internet-status-checker
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a Web Browser**:

   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

4. **Check Internet Status**:

   - Upon loading the webpage, the application will automatically attempt to fetch a resource (e.g., an image) from a specified URL.
   - The status message will update in real-time to indicate whether the internet connection is active or if there's an issue.

### Project Structure

The **INTERNET STATUS CHECKER** project consists of the following files:

- **`index.html`**:
  - HTML file containing the structure of the internet status checker interface.

- **`styles.css`**:
  - CSS file for styling the internet status checker interface.

- **`script.js`**:
  - JavaScript file containing the logic to check the internet connection and update the status message dynamically.

### Implementation Details

The internet status checker is implemented using JavaScript:

- The JavaScript (`script.js`) file:
  - Contains an event listener that attempts to fetch a resource (e.g., an image) from a specified URL (e.g., Google's logo).
  - Updates the status message based on the success or failure of the network request.

### Example

Interact with the **INTERNET STATUS CHECKER** by opening the webpage and observing the status message displayed:

- If the internet connection is active, the status message will indicate "Internet connection is available".
  
- If there's an issue with the internet connection (e.g., network error), the status message will display an error message such as "Internet connection is not available".
